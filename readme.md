## **Getting Started**

### **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher.
- **npm**: v6 or higher.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Properly set up on your machine or a remote server.

---

### **2. Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/<YourRepository>.git
   cd <YourRepository>
   ```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Node.js dependencies:

    npm install

### **4.Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a file named config.env in the root directory of the project and configure it as follows:

    DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
    DATABASE_USER=your_database_username
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password

    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
    PORT=3000

    Example:

    DATABASE_URI=postgres://localhost:5432/ecommerce_db
    DATABASE_USER=admin
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=securepassword

    JWT_SECRET=myultrasecretjwtkey
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
    PORT=3000

    Replace your_database_uri, your_database_username, your_database_password, and other placeholders with your specific values.

### **5.Start the Server**

Start the application by running:

    npm start

    The server will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or the port you configured in config.env).
